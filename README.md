## Description

Use Phoenix web framework to implement a WebSocket interface to your part I implementation. That means that, even though the Elixir implementation of your Part I project could use the Erlang messaging to allow client-server implementation, you now need to design and use a proper WebSocket interface. 
Specifically:

-Design a JSON based API that represents all messages and their replies (including errors)

-Rewrite your engine using Phoenix to implement the WebSocket interface

-Rewrite your client to use WebSockets.
